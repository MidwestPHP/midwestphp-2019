            <h3>What's Included</h3>
            <p>Your ticket comes with a lot more than just entrance to the conference. You'll also get free breakfast and
              lunch each day! Tickets do NOT include a hotel stay, you must book that separately. We highly suggest staying
              at the Radisson Blue Mall of America. We have a block of rooms at a discounted price.</p>
